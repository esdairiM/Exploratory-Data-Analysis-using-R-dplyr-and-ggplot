# Exploratory data analysis project

This is my work for exploratory data analysis on Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data of 2013, the dataset contains a lot of variables, but I am just interested in applying basic statistics using R and dplyr to see what I can learn from this data.

## to see the code:
Open .Rmd file

## if you don't have time to run the code:
Open the .pdf file generated from the .Rmd file
